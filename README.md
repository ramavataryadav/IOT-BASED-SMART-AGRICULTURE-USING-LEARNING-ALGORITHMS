# Smart Irrigation and Animal Detection System

## Overview

This project is a smart agriculture system that integrates automatic irrigation with animal detection using image classification. It utilizes various sensors, a camera module, and cloud connectivity to monitor and control the irrigation process while also identifying animals that may pose threats to the crops.

## System Components

### 1. Sensors
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Monitors the moisture level in the soil.
- **Humidity Sensor**: Measures atmospheric humidity.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Tracks ambient temperature.
- **Water Level Sensor**: Checks the water level in the irrigation tank.

### 2. Camera
- **OV2640 Camera Module**: Captures images for animal detection.

### 3. Controllers
- **Arduino Board**: Collects sensor data and controls actuators via relays.
- **ESP32 Controller**: Interfaces with the camera module and processes image data.
- **NodeMCU (ESP8266)**: Sends sensor data to the cloud and mobile device.

### 4. Actuators
- **Motor Pump**: Supplies water for irrigation.
- **Sprinkler Operating System**: Distributes water over the crops.
- **Relay Modules**: Used to switch the motor and sprinkler systems on/off based on control logic.

### 5. Software & Cloud
- **Thingspeak Cloud**: Receives and stores sensor data for monitoring and visualization.
- **Mobile Device Interface**: Allows remote monitoring and alerts.
- **Multiclass Image Classification Algorithm**: Detects and classifies animals using images captured by the camera.

## Functional Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - The Arduino board collects environmental data from sensors.
   - The ESP32 controller captures images through the OV2640 camera.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Image data is analyzed using a machine learning-based image classification model to detect animals.
   - Sensor readings are used to determine irrigation needs.

3. **Actuation**:
   - Based on processed data, relays control the motor pump and sprinkler system.
   - Alerts are sent to the mobile device if an animal is detected.

4. **Cloud Integration**:
   - NodeMCU sends data to Thingspeak Cloud.
   - The mobile device retrieves real-time updates from the cloud and animal detection system.

## Features

- Autonomous irrigation control.
- Real-time animal detection using machine learning.
- Remote monitoring via mobile device.
- Cloud-based data storage and analytics (via Thingspeak).

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with voice-controlled assistants (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant).
- Advanced image classification for more accurate animal identification.
- Weather prediction-based irrigation scheduling.

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Python (for ML model if offline)
- ESP32 & ESP8266 libraries
- Thingspeak API
- Relay modules and connected actuators
